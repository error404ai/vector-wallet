# 🧠 Vector Wallet

**Vector Wallet** is an open-source browser-injected Solana wallet designed specifically for **AI-powered automation**.

Unlike traditional wallets, Vector Wallet enables AI agents  to **automatically approve transactions** without user interaction — but **only after the user has explicitly opted in**.

⚠️ **This wallet is not affiliated with Phantom.**
It is a developer tool created to experiment with AI-controlled blockchain workflows on **devnet/testnet**.

## 🛠️ What Makes Vector Wallet Different?

✅ **AI-first Design**  
Built for use with agents like GPT, Grok, DeepSeek, etc. Vector Wallet responds to natural language commands such as:

> “Go to pump.fun and launch a token. Then buy 100,000 tokens.”

✅ **Auto-Signing with Consent**  
Once the user explicitly opts in (via permit or settings), the wallet allows trusted AI workflows to **auto-approve transactions**, enabling full automation of:

- Token launches  
- Airdrop claims  
- NFT mints  
- Liquidity additions  
- dApp interactions  
- And more...

✅ **Phantom-Compatible API**  
Mimics the `window.solana` interface so dApps think it’s Phantom, enabling seamless integration.

✅ **No popups or wallet UI interruptions**  
Once enabled, AI agents can handle the full flow without human approval screens — ideal for bot flows, campaign management, testing, etc.

## 🔐 Security Model

- **Auto-signing is disabled by default**
- Only activates after user opt-in via JSON permit or dev-mode toggle  
- All sessions are **limited by max spend**, **whitelisted programs**, and **expiry**
- Every action is logged in a local audit trail (exportable as JSON)  
- Works only on **devnet/testnet** unless explicitly enabled for advanced testing

## 🧪 Use Cases

- 🧠 Train an AI agent to learn how to interact with crypto wallets  
- 🤖 Automate repetitive Solana workflows (e.g. token launches)  
- 🧪 Test auto-trading strategies, mints, raffles, etc.  
- 🧰 Run Vector Wallet in "silent mode" to simulate UX for thousands of accounts  
- 🔄 Interact with pump.fun, Jupiter, Tensor, or any Solana dApp  
- 🎯 Power automated testnets or Solana gaming agents
