# Vector Wallet

Open-source Solana wallet for developers and AI automation demos (devnet/testnet only).

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Vector Wallet is for **development, demos and research**.  
It does **NOT** auto‑sign transactions or bypass wallet consent. All signing requires explicit user approval unless the user deliberately sets up an on‑chain delegation.  
**Do not** use this with mainnet funds unless audited and you know what you’re doing.
